# Rosmaster Robot Arm Control

This repository contains code for controlling the Rosmaster robot arm using Python. The code demonstrates how to control servo motors and read their angles using the Rosmaster library.

## Features

- Control individual servo motors
- Control multiple servo motors simultaneously
- Read servo motor angles
- Torque control for manual operation
- Interactive control using Jupyter widgets

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Rosmaster_Lib
- ipywidgets
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install Rosmaster_Lib ipywidgets jupyter
```

2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Open `9.arm_servo.ipynb` to start controlling the robot arm.

## Examples

- Single servo control with interactive slider
- Multiple servo control with multiple sliders
- Reading servo angles
- Torque control for manual operation
